A machine learning model unfortunately can not deal with categorical variables ( except for some models such as [ LightGBM ] ( Encoding Variables ) .

These include : ProductName , EngineVersion , AppVersion , AvSigVersion , PlatformRoleName , Census_OSVersion , Census_OSArchitecture , Census_OSInstallTypeName , Census_OSGenuineStateName , Census_GenuineChannelName , and Census_FlightRing
927	Based on the work set out by Roberto , I 've created a scikit-learn transformer class that can be used to remove columns that are significantly different from the others . This class is based on a standard scikit-learn transformer and also uses the statsmodel library for calculating the VIF number . Information on scikit-learn transformers can be found [ here ] ( whilst the docs for the statsmodel function can be found [ here
1029	Now that we have pretty much saturated the learning potential of the model on english only data , we train it one more epoch on the validation set , which is significantly smaller but contains a mixture of diffferent languages .
622	We see that accuracy is superior to 3 . And accuracy is superior to 2 . What is the accuracy of these 2 models Let us see if our model performs any better than the previous one .

289	For commit_num , the number of commit ( commit_num , dropout_model , FVC_weight , and lb_score
1064	As the data is ready for training , let 's define a function to load images and then validate the images .
290	For commit_num , ` Commit_weight ` , ` Dropout_model ` , ` FVC_weight ` and ` lb_score ` . ` Commit_num ` is ` 19 ` . ` Dropout_model ` is ` 0.38 ` . It is obvious that ` Commit_num ` is ` 28 ` . Let 's check it .
751	UMAP - UMAP - Principal Component Analysis SNE - T-SNE decomposition .
185	Before we do any feature engineering , we need to take a look at the distribution of price of each category . To do so , we can first calculate the mean price for each category .
820	This dataset contains anonymized set of variables that describe different Mercedes cars . The ground truth is labeled ' y ' and represents the time ( in seconds ) that the car took to pass testing . Let us first import the necessary modules .
367	In this section we will try to convert an image to an ` numpy ` array . If that does n't work we will return an ` np.ndarray ` instead .

202	Pretty cool , no Anyway , when you want to use this mask , remember to first apply a dilation morphological operation on it ( i.e . with a circular kernel ) . This expands the mask in all directions . The air + structures in the lung alone will not contain all nodules , in particular it will miss those that are stuck to the side of the lung , where they often appear ! So expand the mask a little This segmentation may fail for some edge cases . It relies on the fact that the air outside the patient is not connected to the air in the lungs

625	Toxic and Non-Toxic Comment Transactions are the most important features in this competition . The objective of this competition is to identify the sets of important features that can be used for classification . There are a number of features that can be used for this competition : 4 , 5 , 7 , 11 , 12 and maybe 9 . Let 's ignore these features for now .
1329	Load libraries
1208	feature_3 has 1 when feautre_1 high than
743	We can see that the number of features is non-uniform and that the macro F1 is non-uniform and has a high correlation with the number of targets . This is because , when the macro F1 is non-uniform , there is a high correlation between the number of targets and the number of macro targets . This also means that the number of targets is non-uniform , while the number of macro targets is non-uniform . Consequently , the number of features in a cell is non-uniform .
1495	As we can see , the program ` program_desc ` is actually a string with the description of the program . program_desc is a string with the description of the program , in this case , a program instance . program_desc is a list of all the program descriptions . program_desc is a list of all the program descriptions .
203	As a final preprocessing step , it is advisory to zero center your data so that your mean value is 0 . To do this you simply subtract the mean pixel value from all pixels . To determine this mean you simply average all images in the whole dataset . If that sounds like a lot of work , we found this to be around 0.25 in the LUNA16 competition . Warning : Do not zero center with the mean per image ( like is done in some kernels on here ) . The CT scanners are calibrated to return accurate HU measurements . There is no such thing as an image

1545	We can see that there are some differences between the train and test data . Now we will load the train and test data
326	Now that we have the dataset we can start the classification process . First , we need to split the dataset into the training set and the testing set . I filled the missing values of the 'toxic ' and 'severe_toxic ' column with the 'padded ' values .

496	In order to reduce the memory footprint of our models , we need to type all numerical features as categorical . In order to do this , we need to reduce the memory footprint by selecting only the categorical features .
527	In order to understand better the distribution of the target variable , we need to think about the different types of target variable . We start with the basic types of target : int8 . We then create a dictionary with the following variables

The ability to relate two abstract concepts also allowed Albert Einstein to formulate the basics of the theory of relativity as he reasoned that an equivalence relation exists between an observer falling in uniform acceleration and an observer

511	Rescaling the Image Most image preprocessing functions want the image as grayscale . So here 's a function that rescales to the normal grayscale range .
517	Since the target column is categorical , we need to transform the column values . The easiest way to do this is to transform the column values into 0s and then replace the missing values with the log1p value .
1471	This notebook uses display_aspect_ratio metadata field as a great fake video predictor .

115	Wow , many columns are missing values , let 's see how many unique values we have per store and item_id .
66	Data Preparation For modeling we have to fill missing values with 0 's . The reason for filling missing values with 0 's is that typically classifiers are more sensitive to detecting the majority class and less sensitive to the minority class . Usually , data with missing values will be ignored by the model . Let 's check the data for modeling .
