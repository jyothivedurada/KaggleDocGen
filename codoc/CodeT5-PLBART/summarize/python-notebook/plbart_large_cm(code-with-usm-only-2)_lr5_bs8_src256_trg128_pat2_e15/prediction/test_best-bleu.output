336	How to Use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset
337	So each of these variables has a correlation with the corresponding ` [ age , domain1_var1 , domain1_var2 , domain2_var1 , domain2_var2 ] ` . Let 's see if these correlations are useful for our predictions .
338	The next step is to fetch the best public data set and train our model on it . We 'll do this in a few seconds , but at a minimum we 'll get a good enough breakdown .
339	In this competition , you ’ ll help engineers improve the algorithm by using a technique called `` Nifti1Image '' . In this competition , we want to use the ` nilearn ` library . With the ` mask_img ` attribute , we can create an ` Nifti1Image ` that is similar to the ` submission.mat ` but with the addition of the ` affine ` attribute , we can create an ` nilearn ` that is similar to the ` affine ` used in the ` submission.mat ` .
340	Independent Component Analysis Principal Component Analysis is a technique which is used to group variables into components.The variables are linearly correlated . It works in way that first component gives the highest variance as compared to subsequent components
341	So , for domain2_var1 , and domain2_var2 , there is a correlation between age and domain1_var1 and domain2_var2 . Let us see if there is any correlation between the age and domain1_var
342	Now that we have a better understanding of the data , let 's plot the two sets of data . We will use the first group as training data and the second group as validation data .

We can also observe a positive correlation between the fact that the store had a running promotion ( ` Promo ` equal to 1 ) and amount of ` Customers ` . However , as soon as the store continues a consecutive promotion ( ` Promo ` equal to 1 ) the number of ` Customers ` and ` Sales ` seems to stay the same or even decrease , which is described by the pale negative correlation on the heatmap . The same negative correlation is observed between the presence of the

734	Undersampling can be defined as removing some observations of the majority class . Undersampling can be a good choice when you have a ton of data -think millions of rows . But a drawback is that we are removing information that may be valuable . This could lead to underfitting and poor generalization to the test set . We will again use the resampling module from Scikit-Learn to randomly remove samples from the majority class .

863	Setting up a validation strategy
864	I sometimes get stuck in too much details that may not be neccessary or are more fun to explore by yourself . As this is just a starter , I like to continue with some ideas and visualisations that have been used in initial work of Bertrand Rouet-Leduc and the LANL-group . One of the ideas was to use features extracted by a rolling window approach . Let 's do the same and make some visualisations what goes on with these features until the first lab earthquake

Since we have a limited number of submissions per day , implementing a metric for the ROC AUC ( which is non-standard in the fast.ai v1 library ) allows us to run as many experiments we want . At this point , I am not sure if changing the metric changes the loss function in the ` Learner ` to optimize the metric . I will be doing more reading up in that area .

1245	From the above snapshot and columns names it is obvious that some of the columns are of type ` float64 ` and some are of type ` int64 ` . But we can see that some of the columns are of type ` float64 ` . What if some of the columns are of type ` int64 ` or ` float32 ` . Lets have a look at the data types
1246	As a starter , let us generate some linear correlation plots just to have a quick look at how a feature is linearly correlated to the next and perhaps start gaining some insights from here . At this juncture , I will use the seaborn statistical visualisation package to plot a heatmap of the correlation values . Conveniently , Pandas dataframes come with the corr ( ) method inbuilt , which calculates the Pearson correlation . Also as convenient is Seaborn 's way of invoking a correlation plot . Just literally the word `` heatmap Correlation of float features
1247	Now let 's check the correlation of these continuous features . As we can see , there is a strong linear correlation between these features . Let 's also check the correlation of continuous features with the help of visualization
1248	Below is the Pearson correlation of categorical features .
1249	All the features are linearly correlated . Let 's plot the Pearson correlation of all the features .
1250	Binary features
1251	After binarization , we can see that some of the values are really small ( some way below 0.05 ) . Let 's try to remove the target column and describe the values .
1252	Now that we have some understanding of the features , let 's plot some correlation matrices . Remember that some binary features like ps_ind_10_bin vs ps_ind_12_bin , ps_ind_13_bin vs ps_ind_153_bin are highly correlated with the binary features like ps_ind_10_bin or ps_ind_153_bin .

1259	We solve many of the tasks within the training set using our Neural Cellular Automata model ! I did test on the validation set as well , and it correctly solved 17 of the tasks .

1283	While the time series appears continuous , the data is from discrete batches of 50 seconds long 10 kHz samples ( 500,000 rows per batch ) . In other words , the data from 0.0001 - 50.0000 is a different batch than 50.0001 - 100.0000 , and thus discontinuous between 50.0000 and 50.0001 .

1317	Majority of the target variable ( minfo_target_to_continuous_features ) is a combination of chi2 and mutual information classes . If the mutual information class is a categorical value , then the minfo_target_to_continuous_features feature will be equal to the mutual information class , i.e . if the mutual information class is a continuous variable , then the minfo_target_to_continuous_features feature will be equal to the mutual information class , i.e .

I do n't have any expercience with respect to other countries in this notebook , so I 'll leave that for you to figure out .
1327	Load and Read Data
1328	This is a better result ! But we can see that ` ConfirmedCases_log10 ` is higher than ` confirmed cases_log10 ` . This could be caused by the fact that there are cases where the number of confirmed cases is not the same as the number of confirmed cases . This could lead to a length of 6 or 7 cases where the number of confirmed cases is less than the number of confirmed cases anyway . Let 's see if that is the case

1490	Let 's create a function that can be used with the ` get_dtw ` function .
1491	The sales item lookups are based on a cluster rather than on the date . In other words , the sales item of a particular cluster is the same as the sales item of a given cluster . As such , the sales item of a particular cluster is the same as the sales item of a given cluster .
1492	Time Series Analysis
1493	The sales item lookups are based on a cluster rather than on date . In some cases , the sales item lookup table is based on a cluster-wise weighted sum of the item counts for that cluster . In other words , the sales itemlookup table is based on a cluster-wise weighted sum of the item counts for that node .

1495	We 'll begin by defining a few helper functions that we 'll use for audio processing . To do this , we 'll need to convert the signal into a 2D numpy array and then feed the function off to a 2D image . To do this , we 'll need to wrap the signal in a 2D numpy array . After we have that , we can use the scipy.fft method to extract the Fourier transform from the signal . This is the first step in making our signal into a 2D numpy array .

1507	Despite the advantage of balancing classes , these techniques also generalize . The simplest implementation of over-sampling is to duplicate random records from the minority class , which can cause overfitting . In under-sampling , the simplest technique involves removing random records from the majority class , which can cause loss of information . Let 's implement a basic example , which uses the DataFrame.sample method to get random samples each class
1508	Random under-sampling
1509	Random over-sampling
1510	For ease of visualization , let 's create a small unbalanced sample dataset using the make_classification method
1511	We will also create a 2-dimensional plot function , plot_2d_space , to see the data distribution
1512	Because the dataset has many dimensions ( features ) and our graphs will be 2D , we will reduce the size of the dataset using Principal Component Analysis ( PCA
1513	Random under-sampling and over-sampling with imbalanced-learn
1514	In the code below , we 'll use ratio='majority ' to resample the majority class .
1515	Under-sampling : Cluster Centroids This technique performs under-sampling by generating centroids based on clustering methods . The data will be previously grouped by similarity , in order to preserve information . In this example we will pass the { 0 : 10 } dict for the parameter ratio , to preserve 10 elements from the majority class ( 0 ) , and all minority class ( 1 ) .
1516	We 'll use ratio='minority ' to resample the minority class .

1618	What is Pearson correlation is a measure of the correlation between two variables X and Y . The correlation is defined as the weighted cross entropy of the X and Y . The formula for correlation is represented as follows C = \frac { 1 } { 199N } \sum_ { i=1 } ^ { N } \sum_ { i=1 } ^ { N } \sum_ { i=1 } ^ { N } \sum_ { i=1 } ^ { N }

1620	Let 's create a function that calculates the mobility for each day . The following function returns the adjusted mobility for each day .
1621	Let 's build a function that calculates the complexity for each epoch . Since we are not interested in the accuracy of the models , we do n't need to care about the time periods that the models will take . Instead , we can just divide the time series into chunks of 100 seconds for each epoch . Since the time series is represented by a numpy array , we can call ` calcMobility ` for each epoch .
1622	I do n't know the formula for this , but if you do n't like the formula , you can try this formula
1623	The metric used for this competition is Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error . The formula for Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error is given in Equation 2 ( FVC ) . The formula for Root Mean Squared Error is given in Equation 2 ( FVC ) . The formula for Root Mean Squared Error is given in Equation 2 ( FVC ) . The formula for FVC is given in Equation 2 ( FVC ) as follows
1624	As the evaluation metric used in the competition is Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error . For the purpose of this kernel , I will use a hyperplane ( a linear model ) to predict the time-to-failure for each epoch . Since the data is time-series , and not time-series , we will use a hyperplane ( a non-linear model ) to predict the time-to-failure for each epoch . First , we will compute the time-to-failure for each epoch . We will use a range of time values for the hyperplane

1626	I will first create a function to calculate the skewness for the training data and then I will use this function to calculate the skewness for the test data .
1627	Kurtosis function
1628	There 's a bit of numpy bookkeeping to learn for a long time . The ` calcShannonEntropyDyd ` function is a wrapper around the ` np.sum ( ) ` function , applied by ` np.log1p ` and ` np.sum ` in ` np.log1p ` . This function is similar to the ` calc_shannon_entropy_dyd ` function , except that it outputs a logarithmically spaced out as a function of the loss function .
1629	For a full dataset , let 's just replace 0 's with np.nan and then let 's deal with missing values in our dataframe .
1630	The idea is to normalize all the features ( features ) in a Panel ( not a Panel ) . This way , the max and min scale will be used to normalize all the features in the Panel . This way , the number of principal components in a panel is reduced .
1631	ie . get_file_paths ( ) function will help us get the paths of the files

1633	First FVC and First Week
1634	While mean squared error is n't the competition metric it is a simple loss metric to help understand how close the models predictions are to the actual labels . The limitation of this error number though is that it ca n't be too close to zero as that would indicate over-fitting a model that should only be producing a trend line .

In this section we are going to define some functions and transformations , which then are applied to the data . It 's good practice to concatinate all tabular data ( train , test , submission
1641	The first big challenge is data wrangling We could see that some patients take FVE measurements only after their baseline CT-Images , and some took measurements before that . So let 's first find out what the actual baseline-week and baseline-FVC for each Patient is . We start with the baseline week
1642	I wanted to know how much this speeds up the processing , you can find the results in the following
1643	The first apporach is using sklearn , as it is super famous and used frequently .
1644	In the next section we are going to use the `` ` train_preds `` ` to calculate the optimized sigma , which is a measure for certainty or rather uncertainty . We can do this by subtracting the lower quartile from the upper quartile ( defined in the loss function ) and dividing it by the standard deviation .

1660	In order to load medical images we need to all load the ` fastai2.medical.imaging ` module . However we will not be able to use the full functionality of the medical images because these images are saved as ` XC ` format which stands for ` External-camera Photography ` hence these images are restricted to pixel values between ` 0 ` and ` 255 ` . This is way limited to say 16 bit images that could have values ranging from ` -32768 ` to ` 32768 ` . Pytorch video augmentation
1661	Let 's have a look at the distribution of the pixel values in the dataset
1662	We can see a few peaks at the beginning and end of the distribution . There are some peaks at the beginning or end of the distribution . I 'm not sure if these are supposed to be bins or normalised .
1663	Here , we can see that there are bins at random and that there are n't any bins at these times . I 'm not sure if this will be particularly useful but it 's definitly worth a try .

1669	It seems we also have a ` signal_to_noise ` and ` SN_filter ` column . These columns control the 'quality ' of samples , and as such are important training hyperparameters . We will explore them shortly
1670	Now we explore ` signal_to_noise ` and ` SN_filter ` distributions . As per the data tab of this competition the samples in ` test.json ` have been filtered in the following way Minimum value across all 5 conditions must be greater than -0.5 . Mean signal/noise across all 5 conditions must be greater than 1.0 . [ Signal/noise is defined as mean ( measurement value over 68 nts ) /mean ( statistical error in measurement value over 68 nts To help ensure sequence diversity , the resulting sequences were clustered into clusters with less than 50 % sequence similarity , and the 629 test
