# Cell2Doc - Machine Learning Pipeline for Generating Documentation in Computational Notebooks

## Notebooks Dataset

Raw notebooks, processed data with the scripts are avaiable in this location: /home/cs19btech11056/cs21mtech12001-Tamal/Notebooks_Dataset

"notebooks_to_dataset"(v3 is the latest) converts raw notebooks to code-documentation pairs and stores in "processed_data" folder. "split_notebook_dataset" script divides the processed data in train/test/validation split.

Depending on the preprocessing logic, notebooks_to_dataset and split_notebook_dataset needs to be modified.
